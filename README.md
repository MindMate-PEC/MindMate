# **MindMate: Secure Notes App with Mental Health Tracking**

MindMate is a secure notes application that not only allows users to store and manage encrypted notes but also offers mental health insights by analyzing note content using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) models. The app helps users track potential signs of depression through everyday writing.

---

## **Features**

- **Encrypted Notes**: All user notes are securely encrypted, ensuring privacy.
- **JWT Authentication**: Users' sessions are protected with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **NLP-based Depression Detection**: Detect signs of depression through written text using advanced ML models.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with React for a seamless and responsive experience.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Efficiently stores encrypted user data and notes.

---

## **Tech Stack**

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **Encryption**: Application-level encryption for secure data storage
- **NLP & ML Models**: 
  - **Sentiment Analysis** 
  - **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**
  - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
  - **Logistic Regression** for depression detection

---

## **Usage**

1. Sign up or log in with your credentials.
2. Create, edit, and delete your notes in a secure environment.
3. The system will analyze your note content using NLP to detect potential signs of depression.
4. All data is encrypted, ensuring full privacy for the user.

## **Work Done So Far**

- Fully functional notes app with encryption and JWT-based authentication.
- Researched potential NLP models for depression detection, including:
  - **Sentiment Analysis**
  - **BERT** for contextual analysis
  - **LSTM** for sequence-based text processing
  - **Logistic Regression** for classification

---

## **Next Steps**

- **Integration of NLP Models**: Incorporate the selected ML models for real-time analysis of user notes.
- **User Feedback System**: Display insights to users based on their writing, while maintaining privacy.
- **Testing and Refinement**: Test the accuracy of the depression detection feature and improve the UI/UX.
